# Greenwood Community Library Website

- on git bash terminal i created a new directory on vscode named TEST
- Then i used "code ." to navigate to my directory TEST 
- i then created all 4 files using the command "touch home.html touch about_us.html && touch events.html && touch contact_us.html"
- asked chatGTP create an index.html page for a company called greenwood library
- so i copied the codes from chat gpt and thereby puting all context in each file 
- i initialized GIT,used then "git add ." command to move to the staging area , the git commit -m  to make the first commit with the comment "my first commit "
- i switched to the main branch with git branch -M main , the i pushed it to github using "git push -u" since its my first push .
