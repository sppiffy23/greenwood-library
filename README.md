- on git bash terminal i created a new directory on vscode named TEST
- Then i used "code ." to navigate to my directory TEST 
- i then created all 4 files using the command "touch home.html && touch about_us.html && touch events.html && touch contact_us.html"
- asked chatGTP create an index.html page for a company called greenwood library
- i inputed all the codes created by chatGPT into each of the 4 files created 
- i staged ,commit and pushed to the main branch 

- i created a branch "add-book-reviews" with the command git checkout -b add-book-reviews, i then created a file named book _reviews.html
- chatGPT created another code in sequence of the previous files created  and it was updated on book_reviews.html
- i updated each of the files in the book reviews section in each of the files created
